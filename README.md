# MCTool
A creative tool for exploring and creating Minecraft resources, managing servers and helping mod development.
This is meant to replace [MCPM](https://github.com/Szewek/mcpm), a mod "package manager" which is no longer being developed.

Most features haven't been implemented yet. **More new ideas are welcome.**
